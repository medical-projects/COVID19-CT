# COVID19-CT


### Problem Statement: 

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 1.3 million individuals all over the world and caused more than 106,000 deaths. One major hurdle in controlling the spreading of this disease is the inefficiency and shortage of medical tests. To mitigate the inefficiency and shortage of existing tests for COVID-19, we propose this competition to encourage the development of effective Deep Learning techniques  to diagnose COVID-19 based on CT images.  


The problem in this challenge is to classify each CT image into positive COVID-19 (the image has  clinical findings of COVID-19) or negative COVID-19 ( the image does not have clinical findings of COVID-19). Itâ€™s a `binary classification problem` based on CT images.
